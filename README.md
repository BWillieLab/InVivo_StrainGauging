# InVivo_StrainGauging
Code for analysis of background strain data, designed for chicken tibiotarsus midshaft strain gauging with one rosette and two single element gauges. 
Each code file is for a different type of strain (axial or principal) and class of activity type (walk; static, e.g. stand; jump), each with an associated .txt file with all relevant information.
