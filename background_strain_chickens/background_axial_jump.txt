Information for background_axial_jump.py

Purpose:
Analyze strain collected during a jump event, to calculate peak strains engendered.

Input:
Excel sheet containing strain collected during a jump. 
Each row is a sample, and each column is a channel from a gauge. 
Code is designed for analyzing strain from 5 channels.

Method:
Code plots the data and prompts user to select points to guide the code in computing peak strains.

Output (each is a separate output file, all in .xlsx format): 
* Filtered input, (Butterworth filter, user should adjust sampling frequency and choose desired cutoff frequency).
* User-generated inputs, 'ginputs'.
* Swing and peak strain.


User-generated points:
Only the x-coordinate of points is of interest, and they need to be selected in the following order:
1. Point on left boundary of jump landing.
2. Point on right boundary of jump landing.
3. Point on left boundary of swing phase (either immediately before jump landing, or in steps following landing)
4. Point on right boundary of swing phase
