background_principal_jump.py

Purpose:
Fully automated code to analyze strain collected during a jump events, to calculate peak principal strains measured with a rosette strain gauge. 

Input:
Excel sheets containing strain collected during a jump, as well as ginput files generated by 'background_axial_jump.py'.
There should be a 1:1 correspondence with strain and ginput files selected.  
In strain files, each row is a sample, and each column is a channel from a gauge. 

Method:
Code converts strain from 3 rosette elements to principal strain (max., min., angle).
Then, using ginputs created during axial analysis, it computes peak strains.

Output for each strain-ginput pair inputted
(each is a separate output file, all in .xlsx format): 
* Input converted to principal strain.
* Swing and peak principal strain/angle and shear strain per input.
