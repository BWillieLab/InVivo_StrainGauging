background_principal_static.py

Purpose:
Fully automated code to analyze strain collected during a static events, to calculate peak principal strains measured with a rosette strain gauge. 

Input:
Excel sheets containing strain collected during static events, as well as ginput files generated by 'background_axial_static.py'.
In strain files, each row is a sample, and each column is a channel from a gauge. 

Method:
Code converts strain from 3 rosette elements to principal strain (max., min., angle, shear).
Then, for each input file, the average and standard deviation is calculated for each channel.

Output for each strain-ginput pair inputted
(each is a separate output file, all in .xlsx format): 
* Input converted to principal strain.
* Principal strain/angle and shear strain per input.
