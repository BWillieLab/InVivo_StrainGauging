background_principal_walk.py

Purpose:
Fully automated code to analyze strain collected during locomotion, to calculate peak principal strains measured with a rosette strain gauge. 

Input:
Excel sheets containing strain collected across a segment of consecutive steps, as well as ginput files generated by 'background_axial_walk.py'.
There should be a 1:1 correspondence with strain and ginput files selected.  
In strain files, each row is a sample, and each column is a channel from a gauge. 

Method:
Code converts strain from 3 rosette elements to principal strain (max., min., angle).
Then, using ginputs created during axial analysis, it computes peak strains.

Output for each strain-ginput pair inputted
(each is a separate output file, all in .xlsx format): 
* Input converted to principal strain.
* Swing and peak principal strain/angle and shear strain per step.
* Average and standard deviation of peak principal strain/angle and shear strain across analyzed steps, number of steps analyzed, step frequency.
