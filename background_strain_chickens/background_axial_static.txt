Information for background_axial_static.py

Purpose:
Analyze strain collected during a static activity (e.g. sitting, standing, perching), to calculate peak strains engendered.
Code is fully automated, and can analyze multiple files.

Input:
Excel sheet(s) containing strain collected during the activity. 
It is imperative that the sheet contain only strains during the activity.
Each row is a sample, and each column is a channel from a gauge. 
Code is designed for analyzing strain from 5 channels.

Method:
For each input file, the average strain and standard deviation is calculated for each channel.

Output for each input file (each is a separate output file, all in .xlsx format): 
* Filtered input, (Butterworth filter, user should adjust sampling frequency and choose desired cutoff frequency).
* Mean/sd strain.


*Results from this analysis have not been "zeroed".
Absolute strain values need to be adjusted using strain values calculated during swing-phase (See "background_axial_walk.txt").
