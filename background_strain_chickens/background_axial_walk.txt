Purpose:
Analyze strain collected during locomotion, to calculate peak strains engendered.

Input:
Excel sheet containing strain collected across a segment of consecutive steps. 
Each row is a sample, and each column is a channel from a gauge. 
Code is designed to analyze strain from 5 channels.

Method:
Code plots the data and prompts user to select points to guide the code in computing peak strains.

Output (each is a separate output file, all in .xlsx format): 
* Filtered input, (Butterworth filter, user should adjust sampling frequency and choose desired cutoff frequency).
* User-generated inputs, 'ginputs'.
* Swing and peak strain per step.
* Average and standard deviation of peak strain across analyzed steps, number of steps analyzed, step frequency.


User-generated points:
Only the x-coordinate of points is of interest, and they need to be selected in the following order:
1. Point on left boundary of swing phase
2. Point on right boundary of swing phase
3. Point on left boundary of first step.
4. Point on right boundary of first step.
5. Repeat steps 3 then 4 for as many steps as there are in the segment.
6. Point at the beginning of the first step.
7. Point at the end of the swing phase following the last step.
